# ðŸ“˜ Insurance Claim & Policy Management System

## 1. Problem Statement
Insurance companies manage thousands of policies and claims, but traditional processes are often manual, time-consuming, and fragmented. Customers face delays in claim approvals, missed premium reminders, and limited visibility into policy or claim status. Agents struggle to manage customer portfolios efficiently, while managers lack real-time insights for decision-making and face challenges in detecting fraudulent claims.

To overcome these issues, a Salesforce CRM solution is required to automate policy issuance and renewals, streamline claim processing with multi-level approvals, provide customers with a transparent self-service portal, and deliver fraud detection alerts along with real-time dashboards for compliance and performance monitoring.
